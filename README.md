# Distributed-File-and-Computation-Server

University of Texas at Arlington - Fall 2022

This project demonstrates the implementation of file servers and computation servers with both synchronous and asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). The project is divided into four main assignments.

Assignments
1. Single-Threaded File Server
Developed a single-threaded file server with the following functionalities:

UPLOAD
DOWNLOAD
DELETE
RENAME

2. Multi-Threaded File Server
Extended the file server to support multiple simultaneous client requests using multi-threading. The functionalities include:

UPLOAD
DOWNLOAD
DELETE
RENAME

3. Synchronous RPC Computation Server
Implemented a computation server supporting synchronous RPCs for the following operations:

calculate_pi()
add(i, j)
sort(array A)
matrix_multiply(matrix A, matrix B, matrix C)

4. Asynchronous RPC Computation Server
Developed a computation server supporting asynchronous and deferred synchronous RPCs for the following operations:

calculate_pi()
add(i, j)
sort(array A)
matrix_multiply(matrix A, matrix B, matrix C)
